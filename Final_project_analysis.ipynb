    "\n",
    "[Insert abstract here. no more than 300 words.]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question is: Is there a correlation between pain reliever misuse in US states and whether [states have expanded Medicaid](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/)? How has Medicaid expansion affected opioid misuse in the US? We plan to investigate the correlation between pain reliever misuse and states that have expanded Medicaid, and whether the rate of opioid misuse decreased after states expanded their Medicaid programs. We picked this topic because, as professionals in public health and biology, we are well aware of the toll that substance use disorders have taken, and the potential that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has to improve access to treatment for these disorders. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will obtain data on the prevalence of pain reliever misuse in each state from the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://datatools.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2019/nsduh-2018-2019-rd02yr/crosstab?row=PNRNMYR&column=STUSAB&weight=DASWT_1) from the Substance and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the status of each state’s decision on Medicaid expansion from [KFF](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/), a health policy organization. We will use the pandas and matplotlib libraries for our data analysis. Below is our exploratory data analysis and some summary statistics.\n",

    "## Data Wrangling \n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert tidying of your data, manipulating missing values, structuring of\n",
    "your data, etc.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data are from the SAMHSA [National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://datatools.samhsa.gov/) 2-year restricted-use data sets for 2015-2016, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2021-2022. No data related to our research question were available prior to 2015 (survey question of interest was not being asked yet) or for 2020 (likely due to COVID).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the SAMHSA Data Tools webpage, we created \"crosstabs\" (data subsets) for the following variables and downloaded the CSV files:\n",
    "-  PNRNMYR - During the past 12 months, if they misused prescription pain relievers\n",
    "-  STUSAB - State US abbreviation\n",
    "\n",
    "We also downloaded Medicaid expansion data (CSV) from [KFF](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/).\n",
