    "# DATA 602 Final Project\n",
    "### Naomi Buell, Richie Rivera, Alexander Simon\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**: Opioid addiction is a public health crisis that has affected countless lives. Medicaid, which is a health insurance program for low-income individuals in the US, plays an important role in helping people with opioid use disorder (OUD) get medical treatment. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid coverage in 2014, but not all states have implemented it yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**: Is there a correlation between OUD prevalence rates in US states and the status of Medicaid expansion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**: We downloaded data on the prevalence of pain reliever misuse in each state from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from the Substance and Mental Health Services Administration for all available years (2016–2019 and 2022) and the status of each state’s decision on Medicaid expansion from KFF, a health policy organization. Data were cleaned and merged into a Pandas dataframe and visualized with scatter/line plots and choropleth maps created using matplotlib and Plotly Express. We also performed linear regression and a paired t-test for difference in means using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**: Forty states had post-expansion data, 10 had pre-expansion data, and 8 had both pre- and post-expansion data. Overall OUD prevalence rates ranged from 1.3% to 6.5% (mean 3.9%). Choropleth maps showed that OUD prevalence rates have trended downward nationwide from 2016 to 2022. Linear regression analysis suggested that the rate of decline in post-expansion states was slightly faster than in pre-expansion states (slope = -0.24 vs -0.19), but R2 values were low (0.2–0.3). The t test was significant (P=0.048), however, not all test assumptions were met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: Our results suggest that there is a correlation between OUD prevalence rates and Medicaid expansion status, and that expansion is associated with a faster decline. However, we did not have enough data points to conclude that the difference is statistically significant.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Opioid addiction is a public health crisis in the US that has affected countless lives. Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for low-income individuals. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), expanded coverage became available in 2014, but not all states have implemented it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As professionals in public health and biology, we are interested in knowing whether improved access to medical treatment can reduce the prevalence of substance use disorders. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained data on the prevalence of pain reliever misuse in each state from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from the [Substance and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)](https://www.samhsa.gov/) and the status of each state’s decision on Medicaid expansion from [KFF](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/), a health policy organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we show our data analysis and findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Wrangling \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data are from the SAMHSA [National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://datatools.samhsa.gov/) 2-year restricted-use data sets for 2015-2016, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2021-2022. No data related to our research question were available prior to 2015 (survey question of interest was not being asked yet) or for 2020 (likely due to COVID).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the SAMHSA Data Tools webpage, we created \"crosstabs\" (data subsets) for the following variables and downloaded the CSV files:\n",
    "-  PNRNMYR - During the past 12 months, if they misused prescription pain relievers\n",
    "-  STUSAB - State US abbreviation\n",
    "\n",
    "We also downloaded Medicaid expansion data (CSV) from [KFF](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
